# React Course Project - TBC Academy Website Replica

## About the Project

This project is a replica of the [TBC Academy USAID webpage](https://www.tbcacademy.ge/usaid), completed as part of a React course at TBC. The goal was to recreate the layout, functionality, and visual design of the original page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project served as a practical exercise in React development, focusing on component architecture, state management, and UI/UX implementation.

## Technologies Used and Why

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
- **HTML**: Used to structure the webpage and define its elements, following the layout provided by the original page.
- **CSS**: Utilized for styling the webpage, ensuring visual fidelity with the TBC Academy USAID webpage.
- **JavaScript**: Employed for interactive sections and dynamic content, enhancing user engagement and functionality.
